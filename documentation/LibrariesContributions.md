> Porting arduino libraries to libmraa as UPM libraries is usually fairly easy. The issues typically come from misunderstanding of how a non real time OS deals with interrupts and timers. It also highly depends on the sensor. [Porting a module from Arduino](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/porting.md)

> A concrete example is explained in detail on @ref [max31855](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/upm/blob/master/docs/max31855.md)
