# Challenge

With this step by step challenge you will enhance maximize the capacity of your Development Board by writing functionality both in User Space and Kernel Space from the topics you have learned during the workshop.

01. Linux Driver Kernel Module LCD Display Features
02. Linux Driver Kernel Module LCD Display Main
03. Linux Driver Userspace Module Temperature
04. Linux Driver Kernel Module Temperature
05. Linux Kernel Mainline Support LCD and Temperature
06. Push your code

# Linux Driver Kernel Module LCD Display Features

Section [Link](url)

__Instruction__ 

> Enable support for the following Display features:
> 1. Display On/Off Control
> 2. Display Lines, 2 Line Support
> 3. Display Shift (Banner, Marquesina), Text string longer than number of characters
> 4. Display Clear

# Linux Driver Kernel Module LCD Display Main

__Instruction__ 

> Implement a Python script to handle MQTT subscribe topic, once a  message is received then display it under the LCD via the Linux Driver Kernel Module

# Linux Driver Userspace Module Temperature

Section [Link](url)

__Instruction__ 

> Write a driver in User Space (MRAA) for your Analog Temperature Sensor from Grove Kit

# Linux Driver Kernel Module Temperature

Section [Link](url)

__Instruction__ 

> Write a driver in Kernel Space (.ko) for your Analog Temperature Sensor from Grove Kit

# Linux Kernel Mainline Support LCD and Temperature

Section [Link](url)

__Instruction__ 

> Look if both Linux Kernel Intel Edison and Linux Kernel Mainline versions (under drivers/misc) have support for the LCD and Temperature modules and enable them, in case support is not available enable both drivers your have written in your Yocto Board Support Package Compilation

Mainline

- [Linux Kernel Mainline](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/)
- [Linux Kernel Mainline Device Drivers Misc](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/misc)

# Software Version Control System Pushing Code
