# Challenge

With this step by step challenge you will enhance maximize the capacity of your Development Board by writing functionality both in User Space and Kernel Space from the topics you have learned during the workshop.

1. Linux Kernel Module LCD v2.0
2. Linux Kernel Module Temperature MRAA
3. Linux Kernel Module Temperature Kernel
3. Write a driver in User Space (MRAA) for your Analog Temperature Sensor from Grove Kit4. Write a driver in Kernel Space (.ko) for your Analog Temperature Sensor from Grove Kit
4. Implement functionality to display data to LCD RGB under
  https://github.com/xe1gyq/TheIoTLearningInitiative/blob/master/InternetOfThings101/main.py
  to make of our LCD RGB Kernel Driver from Marquito 
5. Look if Linux Kernel has mainline support for this LCD and enable
6. Enable Serial Communication between Intel Edison and Arduino 101 / Genuino 101
6. Push your code
