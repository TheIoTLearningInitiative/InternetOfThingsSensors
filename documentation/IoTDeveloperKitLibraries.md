# Intel® IoT Developer Kit

> The developer kit is optimized for rapid prototyping—a way to prove or enhance your ideas or turn them into products. The kit provides all the hardware and software you need to speed up prototyping and time to production. [Homepage](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/dev-kit)

# Developer Products

> We offer a variety of boards that serve the full range of development audiences and projects. Each board includes an installer that updates your board and helps establish your development environment.

# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

> Each board supports one or more of the following IDEs:
> > Intel® XDK (Node.js*)
> > Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (C/C++, Java*)
> > Intel® System Studio for Microcontrollers (C/C++)

# Sensors

> Choose from a wide range of sensors and actuators to help your prototype interact with your environment.

# Middleware Libraries

## MRAA

> Interface with the I/O on your board using this C/C++ library that has bindings to Javascript* and Python*.

## UPM

> Create easy function calls to your sensors for reading, setting, and displaying values with this high-level repository for sensors and actuators that use MRAA.

# Middleware Libraries for Microcontrollers

## ZMRAA

> The MRAA implementation for Zephyr provides a way to use the MRAA C API on Zephyr enabled devices, such as the Arduino 101 (branded Genuino 101* outside the U.S.) and the Intel® Quark™ Microcontroller Developer Kit D2000
