# Objectives

- Using libraries (UPM & MRAA)
  - We will start with baby steps to shows how kids and not so hardcore nerds communicate with sensors
- Look Ma! without Handles! (writing our own sensor code in user space
  - Then we will throw away UPM & MRAA libraries to teach you how to use user space i2C  libraries to communicate directly with your device
- I'm a Pro! Turning our sensor code into a Linux kernel module
  - We have gone way beyond from the comfort zone, lets get into the Linux Kernel as the next step of for optimization
