# Objectives

* <font color="blue">Using libraries (UPM & MRAA)</font>
  * We will start with baby steps to shows how kids and not so hardcore nerds communicate with sensors
* <font color="blue">Look Ma! without Handles! (writing our own sensor code in user space)</font>
  * Then we will throw away UPM & MRAA libraries to teach you how to use user space i2C  libraries to communicate directly with your device.
* <font color="blue">I'm a Pro! (turning our sensor code into a module)</font>
  * We have gone way beyond from the comfort zone, lets get into the Kernel
