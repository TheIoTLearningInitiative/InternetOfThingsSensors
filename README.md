Internet of Things Sensors

Simply stated, a sensor is an electronic component that measures some aspect of the physical world and converts that measurement into varying electrical characteristics, namely voltage or resistance. Sensors can sense things like light, movement, temperature, and touch. They are exciting because they make the physical world perceivable by computers—even tiny computers like microcontrollers.
As you get deeper into the realm of interactivity, it’s worth considering the wide range of sensors available to you. In this chapter, you’ll take a moment to consider how you can best listen to what’s happening in, on, and around the body through technological means. You’ll encounter an assortment of body-centric sensors and look at some simple ways to work with the data they produce.

Sensors surround you in daily life. The world is full of them: from passive infrared sensors in motion detectors, to CO2 detectors in air conditioning systems, and even tiny accelerometers, GPS modules, and cameras inside your smartphone and tablet—sensors are everywhere! The variety of sensor applications is remarkable.
It’s safe to assume that if an electronic device is considered “smart,” it’s full of sensors (Figure 1-1). In fact, thanks to the proliferation of smart devices, especially phones, the price of sensors has been driven to affordability. Not only is it economically viable to add advanced sensors to your projects, but they vastly expand the kinds of projects you can make.
You’ll learn about sensors in this book by making small projects and reflecting on the experience. It’s more fun to build first and discuss later, but both are equally important. It’s best to avoid the temptation to only build projects and skip the conceptual sections.
Getting started with sensors is easy, and only the sky is the limit. Electronics challenge some of the best brains daily and produce new innovations and dissertations. On the other hand, even a child can get started with some guidance.
If you don’t know much about sensors yet, try to remember what it feels like now. After you’ve tackled some challenges and built a couple of gadgets, many dark mysteries of sensors will probably seem like common sense to you.
This book is suitable for anyone with an interest in sensors (see Figure 1-2). After you’ve built the gadgets and have read this book, you can get ideas for bigger projects from our book Make: Arduino Bots and Gadgets or learn more advanced sensors in Make: Sensors . For a wider view of the basics, see Getting Started with Arduino, 2nd Edition by Massimo Banzi, Getting Started with Raspberry Pi by Matt Richardson and Shawn Wallace, or Make: Electronics by Charles Platt.
